ketils is a python package that provides several utilities related to KEGG.
With this package, you will be able to use functions such as searching KEGG database or pathway mapping.
It was made by referring to the KEGG module in the bioservices package, so there should be some similarities.

There may be some errors in the code. We will fix as soon as possible. 
If you notice anything strange, please feel free to contact us at any time.
